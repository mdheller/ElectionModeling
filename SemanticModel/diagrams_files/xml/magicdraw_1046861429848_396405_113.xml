be reused by other packages. Model libraries are frequently
used in conjunction with applied profiles. This is expressed
by defining a dependency between a profile and a model
library package, or by defining a model library as contained
in a profile package. The classes in a model library are not
stereotypes and tagged definitions extending the metamodel.
A model library is analogous to a class library in some
programming languages.
When a model library is defined as a part of a profile, it is
imported or deleted with the application or removal of the
profile. The profile is implicitly applied to its model library.
In the other case, when the model library is defined as an
external package imported by a profile, the profile requires
that the model library be there in the model at the stage of the
profile application. The application or the removal of the
profile does not affect the presence of the model library
elements.</body><documentation humanName="Documentation"/><owner classType="Stereotype" humanName="Owner" humanType="Stereotype" icon="diagrams_files/icon_stereotype_2041996211.png" mode="s,e" name="ModelLibrary" refid="magicdraw_1046861421236_39100_29"/><owningElement classType="Stereotype" humanName="Owning Element" humanType="Stereotype" icon="diagrams_files/icon_stereotype_2041996211.png" name="ModelLibrary" refid="magicdraw_1046861421236_39100_29"/><TO_DO humanName="To Do" mode="s,e"/></comment></magicdraw>
