language (e.g., C++, Smalltalk, Java) in which an instance
may not have more than one class. This is in contrast to
Class, for which an instance may have multiple classes at one
time and may gain or lose classes over time, and an object (a
child of instance) may dynamically
have multiple classes.
An Implementation class is said to realize a Classifier if it
provides all of the operations defined for the Classifier with
the same behavior as specified for the Classifier's operations.
An Implementation Class may realize a number of different
Types. Note that the physical attributes and associations of
the Implementation class do not have to be the same as those
of any Classifier it realizes and that the Implementation
Class may provide methods for its operations in terms of its
physical attributes and associations.
